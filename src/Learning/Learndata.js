    heading: "üîç What is Cryptography?",
    description:
      "Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it. It involves creating written or generated codes that allow information to be kept secret.",

    heading: "üîê What is Encryption?",
    description:
      "Encryption is the process of converting plain text into ciphertext. This makes the original information unreadable without a special key used to decrypt it. Encryption is used to protect sensitive data like personal information, financial details, and confidential communication.",
    example:
      "Think of it like sending a locked box through the mail. If you have the key (encryption key), you can open the box (decrypt the message).",

    heading: "üîì What is Decryption?",
    description:
      "Decryption is the process of converting encrypted data back into its original form, known as plaintext. It allows the recipient of the encrypted data to decode the ciphertext using a decryption key.",
    example:
      "When the locked box (encrypted message) reaches the intended recipient, they use their key (decryption key) to open it and read the message.",

    heading: "üßÆ Simple Algorithms",
    description:
      "Simple cryptographic algorithms include methods like Caesar Cipher, Substitution Cipher, and Transposition Cipher. These are basic techniques for altering text to make it unreadable.",
    example:
      "Caesar Cipher: Shifts letters in the alphabet by a set number. Example: With a shift of 3, A becomes D, B becomes E, etc. Substitution Cipher: Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. Transposition Cipher: The positions held by units of plaintext are shifted according to a regular system.",
