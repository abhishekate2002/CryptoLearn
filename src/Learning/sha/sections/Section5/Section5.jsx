        <b className="small-heading2">Initial Processing:</b>Data is prepped for
        hashing by padding it until its length is 448 mod 512. The padding
        starts with a 1 followed by 0s, ensuring the last 64 bits represent the
        original data length.

        <b className="small-heading2">Message Blocks:</b>The processed data is
        divided into 512-bit blocks, each dissected into 16 words (32-bit each)
        to form a message schedule of 64 words.

        <b className="small-heading2">Compression Magic:</b>SHA-256 compresses
        these blocks through 64 iterations, using bitwise operations, logical
        functions (such as CH and MAJ), and modular addition. These operations
        are meticulously designed to achieve avalanche effect ‚Äì a small change

        Using SHA-256 on your website, especially for password storage, adds a
        layer of security. However, remember that hashing isn't encryption. It's
